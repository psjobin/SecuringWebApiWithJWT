Securing a web api


first ... set up startup.cs to use json web tokens with a secret key

then create a get token method.. (allow anon)
if the username and password matches.. create a web token using the same secret key as set up in startup.cs




What Are JSON Web Tokens (JWT)?
JSON Web Token is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a safe, compact, and self-contained, secured way for transmission 
of information between a sender and a receiver through a URL, a POST parameter, or inside the HTTP Header. It should be 
noted that the information to be transmitted securely between two parties is represented in JSON format and it is 
cryptographically signed to verify its authenticity. JWT is typically used for implementing authentication and authorization 
in Web applications. Because JWT is a standard, all JWTs are tokens but the reverse is not true. 
You can work with JSON Web Tokens in .NET, Python, Node.js, Java, PHP, Ruby, Go, JavaScript, etc.




JWT is represented as a combination of three base64url encoded parts concatenated with period ('.') characters and comprises the following three sections:

Header
Payload
Signature
